      While it may be tempting to welcome a cat into your family, there're some things to be mindful of - not just for your future cat
      to be happy, but also to establish the best possible relationship with your kitty from the get go!
      Beyond the obvious - like loving your kitten and making sure that it knows that - here's a little checklist
      to help you get started.
    </p>
    <!-- Things to do checklist -->
    <h3>Things to Do:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Kitten proof your house - this means that bleach and any toxic materials to cats should be locked away.
        Also, your kittens shouldn't have access to any sharp objects. After all, you don't want to be taking
        your kitten to the vet within hours of bringing it home!
      </li>
      <li>
        Invest in toys - things like balls, feathers and tunnels. Items like cardboard boxes are also great as they
        keep your kitten entertained, but are also relatively cost effective and can be replaced easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the kitten to one room until it's fully litter trained. Not only will this help your cat grow used
        to its new environment, but it'll also let them become familiar with the process of using a litter tray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take your time introducing your kitten to other members of the household. Remember that any other
        pets will also have to get used to their new family member.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure to go to the vet as soon as possible. You not only want your kitty to be up to date
        with its vaccinations, but also make sure that it receives worm treatment. Moreover,
        any health issues should be addressed as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do your research - read up on <a href="how_to_feed_your_cat.html">what kind of food your kitten will require</a> and what common behaviours kittens
        exhibit. This will help you better understand why your cat is behaving the way it does.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide early on where your cat will eat - this will help you and your kitty to establish
        a routine early on. In the same vein, make sure that the place where you keep the litter trays
        is quiet and non-disruptive for the kitten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the kitten keep something from its mother - be it a scarf with her scent on it or a
        toy that it played with in its previous home. This will help your kitten settle in.
      </li>
    </ul>
