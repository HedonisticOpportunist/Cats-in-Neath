    <!-- Introduction Text -->
    <p>
      While it may be very tempting to welcome a cat into your family, there are some things to be mindful of - not just for your future cat
      to be happy, but also to ensure that you establish the best possible relationship with your kitty from the get go!
      Beyond the obvious - like loving your kitten and making sure that it knows that - here's a little checklist
      to help you get started.
    </p>
    <!-- Things to Do -->
    <h3>Things to Do:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Kitten proof your house - this means that bleach and any toxic materials to cats should be locked away
        and that your kittens should not have access to any sharp objects. After all, you don't want to be taking
        your kitten to the vet within hours of bringing it home!
      </li>
      <li>
        Get some good toys - things like balls, feathers and tunnels. Things like cardboard boxes are also great as they
        keep your kitten entertained, but are also relatively cost effective and be replaced easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the kitten to one room until it is fully litter trained. Not only will this help your kitty get used
        to its new environment, but it will help them become familiar with the process of using a litter tray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take your time to introducing your kitten to other members of the household. Remember that any other
        pets will also have to get used to their new family member as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure to go the vet as soon as possible. You not only want your kitty to be up to date with kitten
        with its vaccinations, but also ensure that it has worm treatment and that any health issues can addressed
        as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do your research - read up on what kind of food your kitten will need and what common behaviours kittens
        exhibit. This will help you better understand why your cat is behaving the way it does.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide early on where your cat will eat - this will help you and your kitty to get used to
        a routine early on. In the same vein, make sure that the place where you keep the litter trays
        is quiet and non-disruptive for the kitten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the kitten keep something from its mother - be it a scarf with her scent on it or a
        toy that it played with in its previous home. This will help your kitten become more quickly
        acquainted with its new surroundings.
      </li>
    </ul>
