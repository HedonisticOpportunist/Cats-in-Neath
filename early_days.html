      It was sometime in early November - no snow had fallen yet, and the only thing I can remember is driving past the city to a house somewhere in lower Austria where I first set my eyes on Toni.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was on a kitchen floor - him and another black kitten running around, being nothing but playful, oblivious little beasts. What already struck me then was how ginger Toni was and how much I wanted to pet him.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not me who picked him though, but my mother, and I will always be grateful for that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Toni was the best birthday gift ever.
    </p>

      We did not even have a proper cat carrier when we took him, instead placing him into a wicker basket that my Ma had bought -- long ago -- for picnics that we never went to. Toni meowed, and I remember how my Dad came up with the name. I liked
      the
      name, because Toni also reminded me of a song that was constantly running in German commercials at the time. I still associate that song with Toni, even now while typing this down many years later.
    </p>

    <p>
      I remember, too, that Dad was grumpy over getting a cat, but that would change, over time.
    </p>

      The first few days Toni meowed and hid underneath the sofa. I was disappointed. After so long, I finally had a cat but could not play with him!
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, though, Toni warmed up to me, coming to me let me pet him and sleeping on top of me. Such a precious creature, he was too - small enough to fit into my hand and so playful that, within a few weeks of arrival, our apartment became a
      much better, livelier place.
