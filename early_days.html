        It was sometime in early November - no snow had fallen yet, and the only thing I can remember is driving past the city to a house somewhere in lower Austria where I first set my eyes on Toni.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was on a kitchen floor - him and another black kitten running around, being nothing but playful, oblivious little beasts. What already struck me then was how ginger Toni was and how much I wanted to pet him.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was not me who picked him though, but my mother, and I will always be grateful for that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Toni was the best birthday gift ever.
      </p>

        We did not even have a proper cat carrier when we adopted him, instead placing him into a wicker basket that Ma had bought -- long ago -- for picnics that we never went to. Toni meowed, and I remember how my Dad came up with the name. I liked
        the
        name, because Toni also reminded me of a song that was constantly playing in German commercials at the time. I still associate that song with Toni, even now while typing this many years later.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember, too, that Dad was grumpy over getting a cat, but he would change his mind, over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first few days Toni meowed and hid underneath the sofa. I was disappointed. After so long, I finally had a cat but could not play with him!
      </p>

      <p>
        Gradually, Toni warmed up to me, coming to me for fusses and sleeping on top of me. Such a precious creature, he was too - small enough to fit into my hand and so playful that, within a few weeks of arrival, our apartment became a
        much better, livelier place.
