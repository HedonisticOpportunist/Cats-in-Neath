  <h1>How to Keep Cats off Laptops and Other Issues ... </h1>
  <div id="text" class="col-12">
    <h3>The Scenario:</h3>
    <p>
      You can probably already picture this. It's Sunday noon, and you've finally got enough spare time
      to read that all important horror book that you've been looking forward to. However, the moment
      you turn on your laptop, here comes kitty and jumps on it! You can no longer do anything but stare at the
      screen in distress while kitty purrs and falls asleep while the laptop keeps whirring and whirring ...

      Let me tell that there are is exactly only one thing to do ... namely nothing! Accept your fate and join
      the league of people who have found it out the hard way. Cats are evil masterminds who have come to dominate
      humankind with their cute faces and loud meows!
    </p>
    <h3>Forget about Ever Wearing that Black Dress Again</h3>
    <p>
      Unless you own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphynx_cat">Sphynx cat </a>, it is more than likely
      that your kitty will be shedding fur all throughout the year. This does not only mean finding bits of random
      fur on your leather sofa, but regularly having the problem of your clothes all covered in cat fur. While it's
      no biggie if you wear light colour, it is an issue if you're like me and like embracing your Inner Goth. Instead
      of looking dark and mysterious, you often wind up looking like a cat owner that has long since given up on trying
      to groom your cat.
    </p>
    <h3>Sleep - What is That Mysterious Thing You're Talking About?</h3>
    <p>
      Once you become a pet owner, you will quickly realise one thing: the cat is your boss, and you will do as the boss
      requires (and not vice versa). If your cat wants attention, it will get it. Even if it's way past midnight
      and the only thing you want to do is count sheep.
