  <h1>Common Misconceptions About Cats</h1>
  <!-- Horizontal line -->
  <hr>
  <div id="text" class="col-12">
    <!-- Page introduction content -->
    <p>
      There are a lot of stereotypes surrounding cats. Such as them being loners, not caring about their owners,
      and - if your cat happens to be black - bound to be cursed. Well, buckle your seat belt and be prepared
      to be surprised, because it's time to clear up some of these myths!
    </p>

    <h3>Cats are Unloving</h3>
    <!-- Text regarding misconceptions -->
    <p>
      Cats are often labelled as selfish and peculiar, only caring about their own welfare and considering others
      a pest. While it's true that cats are less likely to obey orders than a dog, it doesn't mean that
      cats don't care about their owners. They do - it's just on their own terms and trust is to be earned rather
      than something you can take for granted.

      In fact, if you take the time to observe your cat's behaviour, you'll notice that cats show
      affection in a variety of ways - be it by rubbing its head against your hand or grooming you by chewing your hair.
      If your cat feels safe and comfortable around you, you'll soon find that it will treat you with
      love and affection.
    </p>
    <h3>You Only Need to Feed a Cat</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of people buy cats, because they're deemed to be self-sufficient and less work than dogs.
      While cats are self-sufficient, they still require care and attention. Not only should you play with your
      cat, but you'll have to check that your cat doesn't feel lonely or bored. Just because
      cats are considered aloof doesn't mean that they don't grow distressed when you leave the house!

      In fact, if anything, cats are very sensitive and require commitment. If you're not ready for that, then
      you're better off not getting a cat at all.
    </p>
    <h3>It's Cruel to Keep Cats Indoors</h3>
    <p>
      There are various arguments on the internet on whether cats should be given outdoor access. While there's
      nothing wrong with that - provided your cat is microchipped and the area is somewhat safe - there's nothing
      wrong either with keeping your cat indoors. In fact, indoor cats are less likely to get run over by cars
      or become involved in fights with neighbouring cats. If anything, they live longer, because they're kept in a safe
      and clean environment.
    </p>
    <h3>A ... Specific Cat Breed Has to Act in a Certain Way</h3>
    <p>
      I may be treading on murky waters here, but I firmly believe that a cat is a cat. It doesn't matter whether
      it's a pedigree or a common tabby. What determines a cat's behaviour is its upbringing, life experiences
      and its own unique personality. Cats come in all shapes and sizes and the same thing can be said for their
      personalities. So don't jump to conclusions, but take your time to get to know your cat.
