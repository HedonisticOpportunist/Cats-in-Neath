  <h1>Common Misconceptions About Cats</h1>
  <!-- Horizontal Line -->
  <hr>
  <div id="text" class="col-12">
    <p>
      There are a lot of stereotypes surroundings cats: they are loners, they do not care about their owners,
      and - if your cat is black - then you are bound to be cursed. Well, buckle your seat belt and be prepared
      to be surprised, because it's time to clear up some of these myths!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Cats are Unloving</h3>
    <p>
      Cats are often labelled as selfish and peculiar, only caring about their own welfare and considering others
      a pest. While it is true that cats are less likely to obey orders than a dog, it does not mean that that
      cats don't care about their owners. They do - it's just on their terms and something that is to be earned rather
      than something you can take for granted.

      In fact, if you take the time to observe your cat's behaviour around you, you will notice that cats show
      affection in a lot of ways - be it rubbing its head against your hand or grooming you by chewing your hair.
      If your cat feels safe and comfortable around you, you will soon find that it will treat you with the same
      respect and affection that you treat it with.
    </p>
    <h3>You Only Need to Feed a Cat</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of people buy cats, because they are deemed to be rather self-sufficient and far less work than dogs.
      While cats are self-sufficient, they still require care and attention. Not only should you play with your
      cat, but you should also be committed to ensuring that your cat does not feel lonely or bored. Just because
      cats are considered loners does not mean that they do get distressed when you leave the house!

      In fact, if anything, cats are very sensitive and require commitment. If you are not ready for that, then
      you are better off not getting a cat at all.
    </p>
    <h3>It is Cruel to Keep Cats Indoors</h3>
    <p>
      There are a lot of arguments on the internet on how cats should be allowed outdoor access. While there is
      nothing wrong with that - provided your cat is micro chipped and the area is somewhat safe - there nothing
      wrong either with keeping your cat indoors. In fact, indoor cats are less likely to get run over by cars
      or get into fights with neighbouring cats. If anything, they live longer, because they are kept in a safe
      and clean environment.
    </p>
    <h3>A ... Specific Cat Breed Has to Act in a Certain Way</h3>
    <p>
      I may be treading on murky waters here, but I firmly believe that a cat is a cat. It does not matter whether
      it is a pedigree or a common tabby. What determines a cat's behaviour is its upbringing, life experiences
      and its own unique personality. Cats come in all shapes and sizes, and the same thing can be said for their
      personalities. So do not jump into conclusions, but take your time to get to know your cat.
