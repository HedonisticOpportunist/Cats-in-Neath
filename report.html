  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Building a site centred around cats was not what I was going to do initially. In fact , I was actually planning to build a site focused on German horror. Not only because the topic interested me on a personal level, but because I wanted to get
    others interested in the subject as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, after spending some time on doing research, I realised two things: German horror is a very niche topic that would not necessarily be very fun to design, especially because of the limited content.

    German horror is a very niche topic that would not necessarily
    be very fun to design, especially because of the limited content.
  <p>
    Furthermore, it would have placed a huge emphasis on research, and I wanted to have free reign over the content of my page without having to worry about spending too much effort on the actual process of writing it. It just did not seem like the
    effort would pay off in the long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, in the end, I decided to build a website about cats - how to take care of them, how to prepare to welcome a new kitten home and other such topics. The site is structured in two parts: relevant articles and more static content, like the
    contact page and the page leading to the AdoptCat app which I wrote throughout my deep dive into the world of web development.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    To be honest, what inspired me to build a website about cats is the fact that I am a cat owner myself. In addition to that, I am also an animal lover who advocates for fair treatment of pets. As such, I feel strongly about ensuring the welfare
    and safety of animals.
  </p>
  <p>

    The other reason why I chose to focus on cats is because I feel that they have a bit of an unfair reputation as being aloof and uncaring. Not only is that stereotype untrue, but I also think it leads potential cat buyers to believe that you can
    get away with treating a cat less lovingly than a dog. Indeed, cats need just as much attention as our canine friends.

  </p>
  <p>
    Another main factor in building a website about cats is that I could focus on the front end development without too much of a hassle. Not only do I have a lot of images of my own cats, but I also have a fair amount of knowledge when it comes to
    felines.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>
    I would say that my implementation of accessibility is subtle, but present in important ways. One of the ways in which I ensured that the site would be accessible is by making sure that the user could make the text bigger or smaller depending on
    their needs. This helps make the site usable to people who have poor eyesight - like myself, in fact!
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way I tried to make the site accessible is by making sure that there was always an option to return to the index page - either by using the navigation bar or clicking on the button that redirects to the ‘Cats in Neath’ page. The
    navigation bar turns into a dropdown when the site is minimised.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way in which the site is accessible is that the colour coordination/scheme of the layout is not trying to be too invasive. I avoid using fonts that are hard to read or have background colours that would make the actual content page of the
    page invisible. I also avoided putting too many images on the site, preferring to keep the site easy on the eyes.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Usability </h2>
  <p>
    Some of the usability features easily tie in with the accessibility, but it is important to point out that the website is not trying to be more than what it is. The content and the images clearly represent the purpose of the site -- namely to be
    a site focused on cats with various articles being featured to help potential cat owners make important decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I avoided adding too many gimmicks into the site - namely animations or videos. I wanted the site to be accessible to as many people as possible, which is why I thought simplicity was a key. As such, I tried to keep the language as simple as
    possible but without dumbing it down. My assumption is that people in Neath are going to be native speakers and, as such, capable of dealing with a more or less conversational writing style.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most importantly, I wanted to build a website that was nice to look at and that visitors would find charming enough to visit in the future. That is why I tried to include friendly colours, cute emoticons and nice images that would inform the
    users of how adorable cats are.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Three Things I Learnt </h2>
  <p>
    Prior to doing this course, I was a complete novice to CSS and Javascript. In fact, the only HTML I knew was the one that I used in order to make a text bold or italic. I never needed or wanted to learn more; however, throughout the duration of
    this course as well as the process of building this website, I found myself not only learning to appreciate the techniques that came with front end development but also had fun doing so.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the first things I learnt was how to use CSS to format my site in a specific way. Not only that but I took advantage of the various frameworks out there, so that I could build on the knowledge I had to further improve on the site. I may
    not have used everything I found, but it was beneficial for me to still come across these various libraries and resources. I especially appreciate how many resources there are out there for fonts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing I learnt was to use tutorials and online platforms to my advantage; I did not merely copy or try to imitate what the online tutorials but enhanced my code to suit my needs. This may not have been the best approach to learning how to
    do web developments as client requirements are there for a reason; however, I wanted the site to look in a specific way and did not fully agree with what the tutorials were producing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>What Went Well</h2>
  <p>
    I think I picked up on HTML and CSS quite well, using the latter to make the site like I wanted it to. I did not fall into the trap of overusing Bootstrap or Handlebars but used them as important resources to further make the website do what I
    wanted to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would like to think that this site is original in how it looks. I am proud of the fact that I was able to use a lot of my own images and that the text content on these pages is my own. One of the things I wanted to avoid is building a site that
    looked like any other on the web.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>What Could Be Improved</h2>
  <p>
    Of course, the limitations of being a student as well as being new to front end development means that a lot of the site features were being built while I was still actively learning how to do things. As such, I probably did not use the full
    capacity of Bootstrap, especially in terms of its grid layout or use Javascript as much as I could have; however, I wanted to build as much as I could on my own without overreliance on too many other sources. Even if I did reuse something, I
    always tried to add my own spin onto things.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is also a work in progress in the sense that I may come and revisit it in the future to add more features and content. In that sense, some refactoring is probably going to happen, because nothing is ever truly perfect, and I will
    probably always find something to tinker with.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will admit that I did not spend much time on wireframes because sources like Figma were mostly unusable for me. It cost me too much frustration, which is why I resorted to hand drawn papers or Paint.
